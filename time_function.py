    """
    Generate the updated weight, profit, and velocity for the knapsack after picking items in a city.
    It attempts to select a random combination of items from the current city and updates the knapsack's state.
    
    The function is designed to handle situations where the total weight might exceed the knapsack's capacity (Q).
    It uses a while loop to repeatedly try different combinations of items until it finds a combination where the 
    total weight is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.
    
    If a valid combination is found, the function calculates the new velocity based on the total weight and returns 
    the updated weight, profit, and velocity. If the total weight exceeds the capacity, it tries another combination.
    
    The function also includes a mechanism to prevent infinite loops. It uses a variable 'attempts' to track the number 
    of attempts made to find a valid combination. If the number of attempts exceeds a certain threshold (1000 in this case), 
    the function returns None. This serves as a failsafe to prevent the function from getting stuck in scenarios where it's 
    impossible to find a valid combination that doesn't exceed the knapsack's capacity.

def calculate_travel_time(cities, distance_matrix, vmax, vmin, weights, profits, Q):
    """
    Calculate the total travel time and profit for a given route of cities.
    
    It starts by performing validation checks on the input parameters. These checks ensure that the velocities (vmax and vmin) 
    are within valid ranges (positive and vmax >= vmin) and that the cities and distance matrix inputs are not empty. 
    These checks are crucial for preventing runtime errors and ensuring that the function works with sensible inputs.
    
    The function then initializes variables to track the total travel time, total profit, and the current state of the knapsack.
    It iterates over the given route of cities, updating the knapsack's state at each city using the 'generate_weight_profit_velocity' function.
    
    The travel time between each pair of cities is calculated based on the current velocity, which is determined by the weight of the items 
    in the knapsack. This dynamic calculation of travel time based on the knapsack's weight makes the function more realistic for scenarios 
    where the velocity of a traveler changes with the weight they are carrying.
    
    The function also includes the time to return to the starting city, ensuring that the total travel time reflects a complete round trip.
